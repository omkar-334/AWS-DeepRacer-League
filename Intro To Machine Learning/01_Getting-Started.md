## 1.2 What is ML

 **Machine learning** , or ML, is a modern software development technique that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data.

In  **supervised learning** , every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.

In  **reinforcement learning** , the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal.

In  **unsupervised learning** , there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.

In machine learning, the problem solver abstracts away part of their solution as a flexible component called a model, and uses a special program called a model training algorithm to adjust that model to real-world data. The result is a trained model which can be used to predict outcomes that are not part of the dataset used to train it.

In a way, machine learning automates some of the statistical reasoning and pattern-matching the problem solver would traditionally do.

The overall goal is to use a model created by a model-training algorithm to generate predictions or find patterns in data that can be used to solve a problem.

## 1.3 Components of Machine Learning

* A **model** is an extremely generic program, made specific by the data used to train it.
* **Model training algorithms** work through an interactive process where the current model iteration is analyzed to determine what changes can be made to get closer to the goal. Those changes are made and the iteration continues until the model is evaluated to meet the goals.
* **Model inference** is when the trained model is used to generate predictions.

**Think about the changes that need to be made.Make those changes.Repeat.**
